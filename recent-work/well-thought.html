						<h3>"write a blog post about Tweet Thought Ranker, make it seem disruptive"</h3>
						<p><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tweet-thought-ranker/bielcffamcadpdeckgaakgjdbjjjogin">Tweet Thought Ranker</a> is a Chrome extension that leverages an LLM to rank tweets on a scale of 0 to 10 based on user defined criteria (e.g., creativity, uniqueness, reflectiveness, thoughtfulness, etc.). The main idea behind it is to improve the feed browsing experience by focusing on more meaningful content.</p>

						<h3>how it started</h3>
						<p>I was listening to <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman/podcasts>Lex Fridman's podcast</a> with <a href="https://x.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a>, where Pieter mentioned using gpt-4 to moderate and fact-check information on his communities. Lex shortly commented on how interesting and pontentially more feasible would it be to rate ideas based on how well thought out / how well argued they are. Levels then talked about doing something similar for Twitter replies, and how Elon could actually use Grok to create a better ranking system for the replies.</p>
						<p>This discussion sparked me on how fun it would be to have an llm judging twitter posts and hopefully helping to find actual meaningful content. With that goal in mind, I decided to take the Chrome extension route as 1. I never built a chrome extension before and 2. I don't see any other way of doing it. The second point is a bit pity since most people use Twitter on mobile and the extension is completely useless there. </p>

						<h3>how I did it</h3>
						<p> With lots of AI-generated code.</p>
						<p> Don't take me wrong here, I do think my knowledge in web development was somewhat essential, but, really, Cursor is a beast. Developing sofware with Cursor feels like playing GTA with all the overpowered cheats ready to be activated via natural language. It also gave me the weird, unpleasent sensation of being an unthankful and over-demanding Product Manager. Putting it all into a balance, it felt great! I also do think the learning experience was really far from the one I would have had if I had it done all myself. The quality and the speed were super nice though.     
						
						<h3>the surprise</h3>
						<p>I took some inspiration from <a href="https://x.com/LinasLekavicius/status/1835808617330585986"> this guy</a> and decided to share my extension on X to see if people would like it. Surprisingly, Levels himself was one of the first ones to like <a href="https://x.com/PedroChem1/status/1857530949959033131">my post</a>. That was meaningful to me. It gave me the pleasent feeling of having my work 'validated' by someone who I admire. Pieter Levels is kind of an expert in indie hacking and building cool stuff, he saw what I built, and liked it.</p>
						<p>Not long after, a decent amount of people started interacting with me, and I was happy to see smart people leaving thoughtful comments. X has a great community.  
						</p>

						<h3>the reflection</h3>
						<p> At the end of the day, my post received a like by Lex Fridman. That was also really nice. After some time I saw that there were some real people (~50 by the time I'm writting) using the my extension. This made me realize I had actually made, a very small, but real, impact in the world. And it felt great. Really great. At that exact point in time, my brain instantly retrieved a memory of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw">video</a> I watched long, long time ago. It's a video from an interview by Steve Jobs, called Secrets of Life, where he says:</p>
						<p> <i>"Everything around you, that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you. ... And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will pop out in the other side; that you can change it, you can mold it. That's, maybe, the most important thing. To shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you are just going to live it. Versus, embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. ... And once you learn that, you will never be the same again".</i> 
						</p>
						<p> Maybe I got too reflective here, and my impact on life was definitely miniscule to what Jobs was referring to. However, I do think I got to actually feel on my skin what he was saying. My life is indeed not the same; I ofically started a never-ending journey to build greater things and have a greater impact on the world. It took me just one hit to be completely addicted to this feeling. And I'm loving everything about it.

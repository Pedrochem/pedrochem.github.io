						<h3>"write a blog post about Tweet Thought Ranker, make it seem disruptive"</h3>
						<p><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tweet-thought-ranker/bielcffamcadpdeckgaakgjdbjjjogin">Tweet Thought Ranker</a> is a Chrome extension that leverages an LLM to rank tweets on a scale of 0 to 10 based on user defined criteria (e.g., creativity, uniqueness, reflectiveness, thoughtfulness, etc.). The main idea behind it is to increase feed browsing experience by focusing on more meaningful content.</p>

						<h3>how it started</h3>
						<p>I was listening to <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman/podcasts>Lex Fridman's podcast</a> with <a href="https://x.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a>, where Pieter mentioned using gpt-4 to moderate and fact-check information on his communities. Lex shortly commented on how interesting and pontentially more feasible would it be to rate ideas based on how well thought out / how well argued they are. Levels then talked about doing something similar for Twitter replies, and how Elon could actually use Grok to create a better ranking system for the replies.</p>
						<p>This discussion sparked me on how fun it would be to have an llm judging twitter posts and hopefully helping to find actual meaningful content. With that goal in mind, I decided to take the Chrome extension route as 1. I never built a chrome extension before and 2. I don't see any other way of doing it. The second point is a bit pity since most people use Twitter on mobile and the extension is completely useless there. </p>

						<h3>how I did it</h3>
						<p> With lots of AI-generated code.</p>
						<p> Don't take me wrong here, I do think my knowledge in web development was somewhat essential, but oh boy Cursor is a beast. Developing sofware with Cursor feels like playing GTA with all the overpowered cheats ready to be activated by your natural language input. It also gave me the weird, unpleasent sensation of being an extremely unthankful, arrogant and over-demanding PM. Putting it all into a balance, it felt great! I also do think the learning experience was really far from the one I would have had if I had it done all myself. The quality and the speed were super nice though.
